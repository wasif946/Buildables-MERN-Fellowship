# React Router SPA – Task 1 (Week 3, MERN Fellowship)

This project is part of **Week 3 – Task 1** of the **Builables MERN Fellowship (Bytewise Limited)**.  
The main purpose of this task is to build a **Single Page Application (SPA)** using **React Router v6.4+** with the following key features:
- **Nested Routes** for structured navigation (`Home`, `Users`).
- **Loaders** to fetch and display dynamic data from an API.
- **Error Boundaries** to handle unexpected errors gracefully.
- **Deliverable:** A working app with Router + Loader.
- **Bonus Challenge:** Explore route-based code splitting with `React.lazy` and `Suspense`.

This task serves as the foundation for Week 3, linking with the next tasks to extend the SPA functionality further.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
